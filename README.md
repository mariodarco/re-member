Nothing concrete for now, just me experimenting. The goal is to write a fully fledged social media app with:

- One human developer
- Google Gemini Advanced 2.0 Flash
- Copilot plugin for VSCode
- Warp terminal

I'm just writing this readme after the first commit and I already had to correct Gemini several times. This is going to be fun!
